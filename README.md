In this repository I have tried to implement LAG model of my own.I have inspired to implement this from a paper ***A Benchmark Dataset of Endoscopic Images and Novel Deep Learning Method to Detect Intestinal Metaplasia and Gastritis Atrophy******[Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36306301/)***. I have trained and tested the model ***LINK*** with Cats and Dogs dataset. I have contacted with original author for the dataset that they had used. But they did not response. The original model architecture is this.
