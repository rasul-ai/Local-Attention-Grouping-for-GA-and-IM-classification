# Local-Attention-Grouping-for-GA-and-IM-classification

In this repository I have tried to implement LAG model of my own.I have inspired to implement this from a paper ***Name*** ***Link***. I have trained and tested the model ***LINK*** with Cats and Dogs dataset. I have contacted with original author for the dataset that they had used. But they did not response. The original model architecture is this.
